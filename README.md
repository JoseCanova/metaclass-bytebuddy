## Next development cicle
### Generate Models that provide elements for "ManyToOne" and "OneToOne" relations on JPA-Model,
#### Continuing the model generation based on database schema, the next iteration will focus on creation of OneToMany OneToOne relation ships, for this, the MetaModel generation of the project schema-metaclass need to provide meta0model elements that describes a relationship between 2 rdbms tables.


##### A bigmistake in a decision statement using Optional in record.
##### Need to fix this by tomorrow , noticed that will not work the "decision tree" as first thought, lack of "deep undestanding of the datastructure" provided,
##### It is still need to understand "both situations" acting in the same method producing different results, still need to think better, but it`s smart understand first the initial adoption of Optional was a mistake. The object in record is not optional it is always nneed to be present, need to be pragmatic with the "funcional view" on all perspectives.
